# All Living Families

The All Living Families (ALF)) files were developed by Michael Ruggiero under contract by ITIS after the publication of the [Management Hierarchy in 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130114) and the final version delivered was dated 16 December 2019.

This 2019 version, to family rank, was developed in two formats. Here only the spreadsheet with a nested hierarchy is used to produce
a [ColDP](https://github.com/gbif/coldp) file accompanied by a BibTeX reference file.

The result is registered in [ChecklistBank](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset/294066/).
